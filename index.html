<p>Gordo was one of the first monkeys to make it into space as part of NASA's space program. <em>Eight monkeys had flown on NASA missions before him</em>, five of whom went by the name of Albert.<sup>1<SUP> </p>
  
  <hr/>

  <P>Gordo's historic flight took place on <q>December 13, 1958</q> when he took off from Cape Canaveral for a 15 minute flight into space. <strong>Even though he was weightless for over 8 minutes the on-board instruments indicated that Gordo enjoyed his journey into space.</strong> Scientists monitoring the flight were pleased to note that the only slight side effect Gordo suffered from the entry into space was a modest slowing of his pulse.</P>

  <h3>The Mission</h3> <!--(subsecion I)-->

<p>The rocket carrying Gordo into space would take off from the Atlantic Missile Range at Cape Canaveral, travel further than any monkey had ever travelled before - over 1,500 miles - and reach a height of 310 miles (500 km) before returning to Earth and landing in the South Atlantic, 1,302 nautical miles south of Cape Canaveral.</p>

<p>"We all heard the rumors that they want to send a monkey up first. Well, none of us wants to think that they're gonna send a monkey up to do a man's work ... what they're trying to do to us is send a man up to do a monkey's work."</p>

  <h4>The Jupiter AM-13</h4>

<p>The Jupiter IRBM (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile) was originally developed by the <strong>US Army</strong> as a long-range successor to its PGM-11 Redstone missile, but was eventually taken over and deployed by the USAF for political reasons. <em>It was also the only one of the United States'</em> early stategic ballistic missiles with some mobility.</p>

  <h5>The Journey</h5>
